    "\n",
    "The robot's motion will be restricted to simplify the assignment. The robot can only move in four different directions: up, down, left or right. It can only move one space at a time. For example,  a robot at the position <code>(5, 2)</code> could move up to <code>(5, 3)</code>, down to <code>(5, 1)</code>, left to <code>(4, 2)</code>, or right to <code>(6, 2)</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about Python tuples is that mathematical operators aren't supported. For example, <code>(3, 1) + (0, 1)</code> will not result in the tuple <code>(3, 2)</code>. To operate on the position tuples we will need to create our own user-defined functions. The examples in A2 and A3 serve as a guide on the basic principles on tuples and user-defined functions that are required to complete Part A."
