    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "In Python, elements of a sequence (eg. list, tuple, string) can be accessed using indexes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is:\n",
    "```{Python}\n",
    "sequence[index]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where index is a number representing the position of the element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses zero based indexing (the first element is index 0, the second element is index 1, etc.). Negative indexes will count from the end (eg. the index for the last element is -1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a nested sequence (eg. list of lists), a single index will return an element from the outer sequence. To return an element of the inner sequence, two indexes are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing\n",
    "You can access a slice of a sequence with the syntax:\n",
    "```{Python}\n",
    "sequence[start_index: stop_index]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The start_index defaults to zero if left blank. The stop_index defaults to the last index if left blank. A third value may be added to specify index spacing - the default value is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reassigning values\n",
    "You can reassign values of a list through indexing and assignment\n",
    "```{Python}\n",
    "list[index] = expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "Values in tuples and strings cannot be reassigned since they are immutable."
