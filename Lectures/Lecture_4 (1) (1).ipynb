    "## While Loops\n",
    "A while loop will continue to iterate through a block of code while its corresponding expression is true. They are useful when the number of iterations is conditional (as opposed to pre-determined like a for loop). This makes them particularly useful for numerical methods, which iterate until the solution converges or reaches a certain degree of accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some caution must be taken with while loops. If the logical expression always returns true, the while loop will iterate infinitely."
