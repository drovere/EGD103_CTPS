# Week 3 Summary

You have now reached the end of the week 3 eContent. You should now understand the following concepts:

- Data types such as `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and understand their importance in programming.
- Conversion between data types such as `int()`, `str()`, `complex()`.
- Boolean expressions, constructed using **relational operators** such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and **logical operators** such as `and`, `or`, `not`.
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` selection statements to control the flow of a program using boolean expressions as conditions.
- Creating piecewise functions using appropriate selection statements.
- Raising exceptions using the `raise Exception("Error message")` statement, where `Exception` can be replaced with a specific exception type such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.

You can use the additional resources below to further reinforce your understanding of these topics.
