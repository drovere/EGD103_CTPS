    "# Iterating an Unknown Number of Times\n",

    "In a previous reading, we learned about the `for` loop, which is used to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterate over a sequence of items (like a `list` or `tuple`), or\n",
    "- Repeat a block of code a fixed number of times when combined with the `range` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are situations where we don't know the number of iterations in advance. For example, we might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count up to a number with a certain property (like the first 10 prime numbers), or the first Fibonacci number greater than 1000.\n",
    "- Keep performing an operation until a certain condition is met (like adding terms of an infinite sequence until a certain threshold).\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, `condition` is a **boolean expression**, and is checked before each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `condition` is `True`, the code block within the loop is executed. This process repeats until condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: note {.danger} | Beware: Infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition never becomes `False`, the loop will run indefinitely, causing the program to hang. This is called an **infinite loop**.\n",

    "To avoid infinite loops, ensure that the condition becomes `False` at some point.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is done by going through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` (hence the `range(2, n)`), and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns `False` as we found a counterexample.\n",
