This method returns a dataframe where entries are <code>True</code> for values that are missing and <code>False</code> otherwise. You can use the <code>sum</code> aggregate to then count the number of missing values.\n",

    "If data does contain significant outliers, a good approach is to use 'robust statistics'. These are statistics that aren't heavily influenced by outliers. The median is a good example of a robust statistic, since the size of the outliers doesn't heavily skew it (unlike the mean)."
