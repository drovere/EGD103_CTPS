    "\n",
    "Boolean, named after the mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), is a data type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. They are also referred to as **logical** values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `bool` type is used to represent boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other data type, boolean values can be assigned to variables.\n",

    "# Relational operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are often not assigned directly, but are often the result of a truth test (i.e., a comparison, or the combination of multiple comparisons). In Python, the following **relational operators** are used to compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Example Expression | Meaning |\n",
    "|----------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| `==` | `x == y` | Is `x` equal to `y`? **Not to be confused with the assignment operator `=`.** |\n",
    "| `!=` | `x != y` | Is `x` not equal to `y`? |\n",
    "| `<` | `x < y` | Is `x` less than `y`? |\n",
    "| `>` | `x > y` | Is `x` greater than `y`? |\n",
    "| `<=` | `x <= y` | Is `x` less than or equal to `y`? |\n",
    "| `>=` | `x >= y` | Is `x` greater than or equal to `y`? |\n",

    "The result of a relational operator is a boolean value. For example:\n",

    "Similar to arithmetic operators like `+` and `-`, relational operators (except for `==` and `!=`) are mostly not defined for mixed data types. For example, the following expressions are invalid:\n",
