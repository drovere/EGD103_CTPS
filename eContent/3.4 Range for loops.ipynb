    "# The `range` function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous eContent, we learned about the `for` loop, which allows us to iterate over the elements of a list or any other sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we simply want a sequence of numbers with a certain pattern, we can use the `range` function, instead of creating a list with all the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create a list of even numbers from 0 to 10, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_numbers = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "for number in even_numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "0\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "8\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine creating a list of all even numbers from 0 to 1000 - it would be a very long list (if you are patient enough to write it)! Instead, we can use the `range` function to generate the numbers on the fly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_numbers = range(0, 11, 2)\n",
    "for number in even_numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "0\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "8\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the range function is very similar to the slicing syntax we learned before. The `range` function takes three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `start` and `step` arguments are optional, and if not provided, they default to 0 and 1, respectively. \n",
    "- The `stop` argument is always required, and it is exclusive, meaning that the sequence will stop immediately before reaching the `stop` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tables show the different ways to use the `range` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Syntax | Example | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| `range(stop)` | `range(5)` | Generates numbers from 0 to 4 |\n",
    "| `range(start, stop)` | `range(2, 5)` | Generates numbers from 2 to 4 |\n",
    "| `range(start, stop, step)` | `range(2, 10, 2)` | Generates even numbers from 2 to 8 |\n",
    "| `range(stop, start, -step)` | `range(10, 2, -2)` | Generates even numbers from 10 to 4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "# For loops with the `range` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range` function is often used in conjunction with the `for` loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers. For example, to print the squares of the numbers from 0 to 10, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for number in range(11):\n",
    "    print(number ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "4\n",
    "9\n",
    "16\n",
    "25\n",
    "36\n",
    "49\n",
    "64\n",
    "81\n",
    "100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining with the `len` function, we can iterate over the indexes of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = [\n",
    "    (1, 2),\n",
    "    (3, 4),\n",
    "    (5, 6),\n",
    "    (7, 8),\n",
    "    (9, 10),\n",
    "    (11, 12)\n",
    "]\n",
    "for index in range(len(points)):\n",
    "    point = points[index]\n",
    "    print(point)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",
    "(3, 4)\n",
    "(5, 6)\n",
    "(7, 8)\n",
    "(9, 10)\n",
    "(11, 12)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `range` function generates the numbers from 0 to 5, and the `for` loop iterates over these numbers, using them as indexes to access the elements of the `points` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "You may argue that the above example could be implemented using the `for` loop without the `range` function, and you would be right:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for point in points:\n",
    "    print(point)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",
    "(3, 4)\n",
    "(5, 6)\n",
    "(7, 8)\n",
    "(9, 10)\n",
    "(11, 12)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And in such a simple case, it is indeed better to use the `for` loop without the `range` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, where the `range` function shines is when we need to use **more than one element of the list**, or when we need to access **elements of more than one list** in a single iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two previous ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on:\n",
