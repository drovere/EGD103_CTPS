When there are multiple lines of code in a cell, Python will execute each line sequentially - from top to bottom. Correct sequencing is a crucial element of programming. Just like a cooking recipe would fail if you performed the steps in the wrong order, a program will often fail if the lines aren't sequenced correctly. Consider the example below:"
