Early on, error messages will help you learn about correct and incorrect Python syntax. Over time you will learn to understand the language in error messages to quickly identify what is wrong with your code.\n",

Runtime errors will also include a traceback of the most recent lines of code executed prior to the error occurring. Use this information to efficiently correct the errors in your code, and ask don't hesitate to ask your tutor if you need help interpreting an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also beware that Python cannot detect semantic errors for you. You should always have some way of verifying that your is working properly - a common approach you will see in the tutorials and assignment 1 is to have test cases for your code."
