    "# Iterating over a collection\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous readings, we saw that Python allows us to store multiple elements in a single variable using a sequence like a list or a tuple, providing the ability to access and manipulate them using indexes (e.g. `my_list[0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when working with a sequence, we often need to perform operations on each element, such as printing them, summing them, or filtering them. This is where **iteration** comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop allows us to go through each element of a sequence and do something with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for element in my_list:\n",
    "    # Do something, for example, print the element:\n",
    "    print(\"Current element:\", element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "Current element: 1\n",
    "Current element: 2\n",
    "Current element: 3\n",
    "Current element: 4\n",
    "Current element: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: note | The `print` function\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we know that the value of a variable can be displayed by putting it at the end of a code cell, and if we want to display multiple values, we can separate them with commas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first = 1\n",
    "second = 2\n",
    "first, second\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we want to display the value of a variable in the middle of a code cell, we can use the `print` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first = 1\n",
    "print(first)\n",
    "second = 2\n",
    "second\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` can also be useful when we want to display a message along with the value of a variable, as in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the capabilities of the `for` loop, let's consider a few use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summing the elements of a list\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are simply re-implementing the built-in `sum` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_elements(my_list):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for element in my_list:\n",
    "        total += element\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "sum_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: note | The `+=` operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+=` operator is a shorthand for `total = total + element`.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching for an element based on a condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to find an element in a list that meets a certain condition, like finding the first even number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_first_even(my_list):\n",
    "    for element in my_list:\n",
    "        if element % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            return element\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "\n",
    "find_first_even([1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: note | `return` inside a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous readings, we learned that the `return` statement instructs Python to exit from the function. This also applies to loops, where the `return` statement will exit the loop and the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the condition is not met, and the loop finishes without encountering a `return` statement, the function will return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above pattern (an `if` statement inside a `for` loop) is quite common - you can imagine replacing the `element % 2 == 0` condition with any other condition, and the function will return the **first** element that meets it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transforming a list\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are squaring each element of a list, and returning a new list with the results. The general pattern is to create an empty list, and append new elements to it based on the original list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square_elements(my_list):\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    for element in my_list:\n",
    "        result.append(element ** 2)\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "square_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",
    "[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: details | Advanced Topic: Passing a function as an argument (click to expand)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may realise that the above function is quite generic - if you want to apply a different transformation, you can replace the `element ** 2` expression with another expression, like `element + 1`, or `math.sqrt(element)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make the function even more generic, you can **pass the transformation as an argument**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def transform_elements(my_list, transform_function):\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    for element in my_list:\n",
    "        result.append(transform_function(element))\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_one(x):\n",
    "    return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "transform_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], square)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext {.output}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later topic, we will revisit this concept again, although you won't need to write a function that takes a function as an argument yourself, but you will need to use one.\n",
