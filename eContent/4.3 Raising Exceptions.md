# Exceptions

In previous examples, we have discussed how Python will show some error messages when we try to perform invalid operations, like `ZeroDivisionError` when we try to divide by zero:

```python
4 / (2 * 3 - 6)
```

```python {.error}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[3], line 1
----> 1 4 / (2 * 3 - 6)

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

This is formally known as an **exception**. An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. Refer to [eContent 1: Python error messages](https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/17088/pages/econtent-1-python-error-messages?module_item_id=1594133) for more examples.

# Raising exceptions

In this section, we will look at how to create these exceptions ourselves. While it seems counter-intuitive to create errors, sometimes we want to stop the program to prevent producing incorrect results.

For example, consider the following function that calculates the area of a rectangle, but does not handle negative inputs:

```python
def area_of_rectangle(length, width):
    return length * width

area_of_rectangle(3, -4)
```

```plaintext {.output}
-12
```

While this is mathematically correct, it does not make sense for a rectangle to have a negative area. As such, we might want to raise an exception if the inputs are negative.

We can do this using the `raise` statement. The basic syntax is:

```python
raise Exception("Error message")
```

Here, `Exception` is a generic exception type, but we can also use more specific exceptions like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc. The string `"Error message"` is a custom message that will be displayed when the exception is raised.

For example, we can modify the function to raise a `ValueError` exception if the inputs are negative:

```python
def area_of_rectangle(length, width):
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive")
    return length * width

area_of_rectangle(3, -4)
```

```python {.error}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[21], line 6
      3         raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive")
      4     return length * width
----> 6 area_of_rectangle(3, -4)

Cell In[21], line 3, in area_of_rectangle(length, width)
      1 def area_of_rectangle(length, width):
      2     if length < 0 or width < 0:
----> 3         raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive")
      4     return length * width

ValueError: Length and width must be positive
```
